## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Note EBDM requires Python 3.x

These instructions will get you a copy of the package up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Before getting started, make sure that you have the following libraries already installed:

```
import pandas as pd
import math
```
### Installing

In your source file, import the library and start using the functions step-by-step as mentioned in the below section

```
import EBDM as ebd
```
For accessing modules, use
```
ebd.<module_name>
```

For reading the data, make sure that youâ€™ve separated ordinal and nominal into separate CSV files.

Usage
```
nominal_features_dict = ebd.read_nom('nominal_data.csv')
ordinal_features_dict = ebd.read_ord('ordinal_data.csv')
```
